CNMAT-MMJSS-2014
================

For this class, we need to install some special files.

This set of files and folders operates as an extension to the Max application.

**Installation:**

Download these zipped archives of the current materials:

[MMJ Summer School Files](https://github.com/CNMAT/CNMAT-MMJSS/archive/master.zip)

[CNMAT 'odot' Files](https://github.com/CNMAT/CNMAT-odot/archive/master.zip)

[CNMAT Externals](http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/files/maxdl/archive/CNMAT_Externals-MacOSX-1.0-78-gd490ddd.tgz)

Double-click to unzip, and place the resultant folders in the following location, depending on your OS:

Mac:
    <code>~/Documents/Max/Packages/</code>

(Folder may not be there; if not, you need to create it.  Be sure to use a capital 'P' and lowercase 'ackages')

Win:
    <code>C:\Users\<your username>\Documents\Max\Packages</code>

(Folder may not be there; if not, you need to create it.  Be sure to use a capital 'P' and lowercase 'ackages')

================

Then:

- Launch Max application
- Go to Max -> Options -> File Preferences
- Add a search path preference for the following folder (+ button), then click on 'choose':

    <code>~/Documents/Max/Packages/odot/dev</code>

- If you're having trouble, please ask one of our beloved TAs!
