CNMAT-MMJSS-2014
================

For this class, we need to install some special files.

This set of files and folders operates as an extension to the Max application.

================

**Installation:**

Download these zipped archives of the current materials:

[MMJ Summer School Files](https://github.com/CNMAT/CNMAT-MMJSS/archive/master.zip)

[CNMAT 'odot' Files]()

[CNMAT Externals](http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/files/maxdl/archive/CNMAT_Externals-MacOSX-1.0-78-gd490ddd.tgz)

Double-click to unzip, and place the resultant folders in the following location, depending on your OS:

Mac:
    `~/Documents/Max/Packages/`

(Folder may not be there; if not, you need to create it.  Be sure to use a capital 'P' and lowercase 'ackages')

Win:
    `C:\Users\<your username>\Documents\Max\Packages`

(Folder may not be there; if not, you need to create it.  Be sure to use a capital 'P' and lowercase 'ackages')

================

Then:

- Launch Max application
- Go to Max -> Options -> File Preferences
- Add a search path preference for the following folder (+ button), then click on 'choose':

    `~/Documents/Max/Packages/odot/dev`

- If you're having trouble, please ask one of our beloved TAs!

**Windows users:**

Please make sure to install Arduino environment, found [here](http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-1.0.5-r2-windows.zip)

The Esplora will not respond well to hot-plugging (unplugging and re-plugging) in general for the course, but this problem is much larger on Windows.  The best idea is to follow the Esplora guidelines below.

**Esplora Guidelines**

Each day, please do the following after finding your seat and setting up:

- Launch Max
- Find my-esplora in `Extras -> MMJSS-extras -> my-esplora`
- Mouse over the menu and wait 3 seconds 
- Choose your Esplora port
- Save patch
- Close patch
